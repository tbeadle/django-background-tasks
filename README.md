# Django Background Tasks Updated
Django Background Task is a database-backed work queue for Django, loosely based
around [Ruby's DelayedJob](https://github.com/tobi/delayed_job) library. This project was
adopted and adapted from [lilspikey's](https://github.com/lilspikey/) `django-background-task`. This fork includes minor fixes to support Django 4.0+ (removal of `six`) and Python 3.12 (removal of `imp`).

To avoid conflicts on PyPI we renamed it to django-background-tasks-updated (plural).
